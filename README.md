# Docker Test Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and run your Docker container for testing purposes.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Docker**: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Docker Compose**: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- **Git**: [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

---

## Steps to Run the Docker Container

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository that contains the Docker setup files. Use the following Git command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

> Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of the repository you want to clone.

After cloning the repository, navigate into the directory where the repository has been downloaded:

```bash
cd <repository_name>
```

---

### Step 2: Build and Run the Docker Container

Now, it's time to build the Docker container and run it. To do this, execute the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

- `--build`: Rebuild the container images.
- `-d`: Run the containers in detached mode (in the background).

This command will download the necessary images, build the containers, and start them.

---

### Step 3: Verify the Container is Running

To ensure that the container is running properly, use the following commands.

#### Check Running Containers

List all the running containers to make sure your container is up and running:

```bash
docker ps
```

This command will show you a list of containers, their IDs, and their status. You should see the `test_docker_container` in this list if it is running correctly.

#### View Logs

If you want to monitor the logs from your container, use the following command:

```bash
docker logs -f test_docker_container
```

- `-f`: Follow the logs in real-time. This allows you to watch the logs as the container operates.

---

## Troubleshooting Tips

- If you donâ€™t see your container in the `docker ps` list, it might have failed to start. To investigate further, you can check the logs using the command above or look for errors in the build process.
- If Docker Compose fails to build, ensure that all required files (`docker-compose.yml`, Dockerfiles, etc.) are present and correctly configured in your repository.

---

## Additional Information

- **Stopping Containers**: To stop the containers, run:

  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```

- **Removing Containers**: If you want to remove the containers and networks, you can use:

  ```bash
  docker-compose down --volumes
  ```

- **Rebuild Containers**: If you need to rebuild the containers from scratch, use the following command:

  ```bash
  docker-compose up --build
  ```

---

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully set up and run your Docker container.

If you need further assistance, refer to the Docker documentation or feel free to ask questions.

**Happy Testing!**
